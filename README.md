# Back-Replay Tackler
My friend Rounded wanted a way to download replays from an old archive link, so he can have the scores locally and try to beat them. I threw together this app which parses the HTML from an old.ppy.sh link (in this case, for testing, https://web.archive.org/web/20121226130435/http://osu.ppy.sh/b/129891&m=0) and converts it all to .osr.

Of course, this doesn't include actual replay data, just the scoring and etc. But it works!
